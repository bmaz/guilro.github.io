title: About me
---

I am a French self-taught developer, mostly interested at the moment in web development. I started with HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP when I was 13, thanks to the french website [siteduzero.com] (it did not get better in quality), and some horrible Javascript tutorials.

I learned to use Symfony in 2012, and decided to give a try to [node.js] in October 2013 because of [socket.io]. I fell in love and rediscovered Javascript again.

Between the first years of secondary school and my master degree, I also became a user of GNU/Linux, learned a bit of C, with GLib and GTK+, and even gave a try to [Vala] during a few months - which I like a lot but is almost useless outside from the Gnome platform. I also used Drupal and its API (I have with it a love-hate relationship) for smaller projects.

I never earnt money from my hobby (my real occupation is to study economics), but I contributed to several projects, and helped non-profit organizations. I would like to participate to projects as a freelancer, keeping in mind the idea that starting a developer career after finishing my master degree is also a (better ?) option.

Oh, and Free Software means something to me.
